# EssentialFeedAgain
Practise the learnings from iOS Lead Essentials again. Replicate the [Essential Feed App](https://github.com/essentialdevelopercom/essential-feed-case-study) with different approaches.

- Use `async/await` instead of completion handler.
- Utilise `UIHostingConfiguration` to configure UITableViewCell layout with SwiftUI view.
- Utilise `#Preview` for building UI layouts.
- Use `String Catalog` to handle localization.
